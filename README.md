# braingoo

braingoo is a compiler written in C for the esoteric programming lanuage [brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck). 

braingoo has both a compiler, which outputs a binary, and an interpreter. The 
compiler transpiles the provided brainfuck code into a C source file.  This 
C file is pretty ugly and very unoptimized, so braingoo leans on GCC to 
optimize during it's compilation stage.

## Prereq's

braingoo is written for Linux and is not designed to beportable. Compilation also 
requires GCC as GCC is used to compile the transpiled code generated by 
braingoo into a binary. Though, support for other C compilers would be trivial to add.

## Building

Make sure to fulfill the prereqs above. A `build.sh` file, using GCC, is 
included to build braingoo itself. Clone the repository and then simply run 
it. `braingoo.c` should be able to build without any special tricks. It's 
written in the C18 standard, and I usually build it with `-Wall`, `-pedantic`, 
and `-O3`.

## Usage

To compile:

```
./braingoo -compile <output filename> <input filename> <-k (keep transpilation)>
```

When included, the `-k` toggle causes braingoo to keep C source file transpiled 
from the brainfuck source (`.transpiled.c`), instead of the usual deletion.

To interpret:

```
./braingoo -interp <input filename>
```
