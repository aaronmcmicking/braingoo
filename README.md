# braingoo

braingoo is a compiler written in C for the esoteric programming lanuage [brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck).

I wrote braingoo in one evening. It's source code is pretty gross. Actually it's really really gross.

braingoo transpiles the provided brainfuck code into a C source file.  This C file is pretty ugly and very unoptimized, so braingoo leans on GCC to optimize during it's compilation stage.

## Prereq's

braingoo is written for Linux and is not portable. It also requires GCC as GCC is used to compile the transpiled code generated by braingoo into a binary.

## Building

Make sure to fulfill the prereqs above. A `build.sh` file is included to build braingoo itself. Clone the repository and then simply run it. `braingoo.c` should be able to build without any special tricks. It's written in the C18 standard, and I usually build it with `-Wall`, `-pedantic`, and `-O3`.

## Usage

To compile with braingoo:

```
braingoo <output filename> <input filename> <-k (keep transpilation)>
```

When included, the `-k` toggle causes braingoo to keep C source file transpiled from the brainfuck source (`.transpiled.c`), instead of the usual deletion.
